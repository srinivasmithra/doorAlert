The IoT-based home security system that utilizes the PIR sensor as a human motion detector and then sends a notification in the form of notification via SMS or e-mail.


1.The main problem in this research is the increasing prevalence of theft and burglary cases. This incident was caused by the busyness of every person in his daily life so he forgot the security of his house. 

2.The IoT-based home security system that utilizes the PIR sensor as a human motion detector and then sends a notification in the form of notification via SMS or e-mail is one solution to overcome the problem that was previously proposed in previous research. 

3.The IoT system requires a Raspberry Pi as a microcontroller that has been connected to the internet, a PIR sensor to detect human movement, and Pi Camera to win images when there are human encounters that are within the range of PIR sensors.
